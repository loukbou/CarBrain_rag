AUTOMOTIVE SERVICE MANUAL
========================
Vehicle Systems Troubleshooting Guide
ENGINE DIAGNOSTICS
==================
Common Engine Problems:
1. Engine Won't Start
   - Check battery voltage (12.6V minimum)
   - Verify fuel pressure (35-45 PSI for most vehicles)
   - Test ignition system components
   - Scan for diagnostic trouble codes
2. Engine Overheating
   - Inspect coolant level and condition
   - Check radiator for blockages
   - Test thermostat operation (opens at 195Â°F)
   - Verify water pump operation
3. Poor Fuel Economy
   - Clean or replace air filter
   - Check tire pressure (proper PSI as specified)
   - Scan for oxygen sensor codes
   - Inspect fuel injectors
BRAKE SYSTEM SERVICE
===================
Brake Pad Replacement Procedure:
1. Safety: Vehicle on level ground, parking brake engaged
2. Remove wheel and tire assembly
3. Remove brake caliper (typically 2 bolts)
4. Remove old brake pads
5. Compress caliper piston using C-clamp
6. Install new pads with anti-squeal compound
7. Reinstall caliper with proper torque specification
8. Pump brake pedal before driving
ELECTRICAL SYSTEM
================
Battery Testing:
- Load test: 12.4V minimum under load
- Specific gravity: 1.265 for healthy battery
- Clean terminals with baking soda solution
Alternator Testing:
- Engine running: 13.8-14.4V at battery
- Load test with electrical accessories on
- Belt tension: 1/2 inch deflection maximum
MAINTENANCE SCHEDULES
====================
Every 5,000 miles:
- Engine oil and filter change
- Tire rotation
- Visual inspection of belts and hoses
Every 15,000 miles:
- Air filter replacement
- Cabin air filter replacement
- Brake fluid inspection
Every 30,000 miles:
- Transmission fluid service
- Coolant system flush
- Spark plug replacement (conventional)
TORQUE SPECIFICATIONS
====================
Wheel lug nuts: 80-100 ft-lbs (varies by vehicle)
Oil drain plug: 25-30 ft-lbs
Brake caliper bolts: 70-85 ft-lbs
Spark plugs: 15-25 ft-lbs
DIAGNOSTIC TROUBLE CODES
========================
P0171: System Too Lean (Bank 1)
P0301: Cylinder 1 Misfire Detected
P0420: Catalyst System Efficiency Below Threshold
P0507: Idle Air Control System RPM Higher Than Expected
